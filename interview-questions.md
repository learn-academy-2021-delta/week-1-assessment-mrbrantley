# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

    Git is a command prompt in terminal that interacts with data stored on Github. Github is a site that securely stores repositories and their branches so multiple can work on the same sections of code at the same time. 

  Researched answer: 
    Git is a command-line tool software installed locallay on the system that is used as a version control system to manage code history and code sharing. GitHub is a GUI service hosted on the web that is used to securely store Git repositories and centralized code. 

2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: 
    Pair programming uses a "driver" to type the code into the text editor, with a "navigator" commanding the driver with instructions to type while also doing research. Having more than one set of eyes on code as it is written helps to catch mistakes and quickly solve coding problems.

  Researched answer: 
    Pair programming utilizes different skillsets/knowledge/strengths by distributing cognitive load and individal talents. A driver is on the keyboard entering info and following instructions given by the navigator. The navigator is watching the driver and researching solutions. 



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
